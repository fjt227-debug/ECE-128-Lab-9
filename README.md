# ECE-128-Lab-9
The objective of this lab was to design and implement a Combinational Multiplier and a Sequential Multiplier. Both multipliers were designed to take two 4-bit numbers to produce an 8-bit product. The combinational multiplier was designed where the output can be deduced in a single step, based solely on the current inputs. On the other hand, the sequential multiplier was designed using flip-flops and registers to store intermediate values while the full output was completed over multiple clock cycles. Both designs were then implemented into their respective top modules to drive the product to a seven-segment display on the FPGA board. Additionally, a testbench was written for each top module to analyze the simulation waveform results. Finally, each design was analyzed based on its respective area utilization. Ultimately, these objectives reinforced the differences between combinational and sequential design and their respective implementation processes.
